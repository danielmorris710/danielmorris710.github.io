## Future Plans For Rock Paper Scissors 
During this project, I realized there was so much more I wanted to do. 
<br>
<br>
A few things I would do to improve the players experience :
- Being able to select the first cards the previous player chose 
- Add a more players  
- A restart button to not have to refresh the page 
- Solo play mode against the computer
- Different levels
